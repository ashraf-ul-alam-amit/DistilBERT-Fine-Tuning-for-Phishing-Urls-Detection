# Phishing URL Classification with DistilBERT and LoRA

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using the `DistilBERT` model, enhanced with **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** to improve performance. Phishing URLs can trick users into visiting harmful websites, posing a threat to cybersecurity. This model uses text classification to categorize URLs as either **Negative** (non-phishing) or **Positive** (phishing).

The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of URLs, utilizing `DistilBERT` for its efficiency and transfer learning capabilities. Additionally, **LoRA** is applied to improve model performance by introducing adapters to the base model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is **Phishing URLs** from the [`kmack`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kmack/Phishing_urls) repository. The data is split into three subsets:
- **Training set**: 5000 samples
- **Validation set**: 100 samples
- **Test set**: 1000 samples

## Model Architecture
The project uses **DistilBERT** for sequence classification. The model is trained to predict whether a given URL is phishing or not (binary classification).

We enhance the model by incorporating **LoRA** adaptors to the base DistilBERT model, allowing for parameter-efficient training and tuning. The base model is fine-tuned on the dataset with the following configuration:

```python
base_model_name = 'distilbert-base-uncased'

base_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    base_model_name,
    num_labels=2,
    id2label=id2label,
    label2id=label2id,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
).to(DEVICE)
```

### Tokenization & Preprocessing

We use DistilBERT’s tokenizer to preprocess text data before training:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)

def preprocess(examples):
    """ Tokenize the input text """
    tokens = tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True)
    return tokens

# Apply preprocessing to datasets
tokenized_train = train.map(preprocess, batched=True)
tokenized_test = test.map(preprocess, batched=True)
tokenized_val = validate.map(preprocess, batched=True)
```


### LoRA Configuration
Here’s a more humanized and shorter version:

### LoRA Configuration

Key parts:

1. **Rank (r = 8)**: The rank controls how much complexity the adaptors capture. A rank of **8** works well, but increasing it to **16** could improve performance if more complexity is needed.

2. **Target Module (q_lin)**: We apply adaptors to the **query layer** in the attention mechanism, which helps the model focus better on important inputs. Expanding to other layers might boost results.

3. **Scaling Factor (lora_alpha = 16)**: This controls the weight of the adaptors. **16** is a good balance, but trying higher values like **32** or **64** could improve performance without overfitting.

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r = 8,  # Rank of the adaptors
    target_modules = ["q_lin"],  # Target layer for LoRA adaptors
    lora_alpha=16,  # Scaling factor
    lora_dropout=0.05,  # Regularization
    task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS  # Text classification
)
```
In short, this setup works well, but tweaking these parameters might lead to even better results.


## Training
Training is done with the following configuration:

```python
config_training = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=DIR_TRAIN,
    auto_find_batch_size=True,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    logging_steps=1,
    num_train_epochs=10,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True
)
```

The training process includes evaluating the model's performance at the end of each epoch, logging metrics like **F1 score**, and saving the best model.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the **F1 score**, which provides a balance between precision and recall. The F1 score is calculated for both the **Base model** and the **Tuned model**.

```python
from evaluate import load
f1 = load("f1")

# Evaluate the Base Model
df_base = evaluate_model(test_indexes, test, original_model, tokenizer)
f1_base = f1.compute(predictions=df_base['pred'], references=df_base['label'])['f1']
print(f"Base Model F1 Score: {f1_base*100:,.2f}%")

# Evaluate the Tuned Model
df_tuned = evaluate_model(test_indexes, test, tuned_model, tokenizer)
f1_tuned = f1.compute(predictions=df_tuned['pred'], references=df_tuned['label'])['f1']
print(f"Tuned Model F1 Score: {f1_tuned*100:,.2f}%")
```

### Results:
- **Base Model F1 Score**: 57.88%
- **Tuned Model F1 Score**: 84.23%

The results show a significant performance improvement after applying LoRA adaptors to the base model. The Base Model (without LoRA) achieved an F1 score of 57.88%, which indicates moderate ability to distinguish between phishing and non-phishing URLs. However, after fine-tuning the model with LoRA adaptors, the Tuned Model showed a remarkable boost, reaching an F1 score of 84.23%. 

The tuned model’s higher F1 score reflects an increased balance between precision and recall, suggesting a more accurate classification of phishing URLs, which is crucial for detecting online threats.
